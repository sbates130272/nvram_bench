This is a slightly modified version of the original nvram_bench.
Instead of taking a memory address it takes a file name that it mmaps.
It also adds a -o option to offset within that file. Finally, it tries
to automatically determine the DMI size by using fstat or seeking so
-dmi does not, by default need to be specified.
